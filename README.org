* Overview

The ~idar~ implements identification analysis and structural causal model estimation in R. The software is particularly useful when the analysis relies on selection on observables for causal inference, making it easy to check if a causal effect is identifiable for any given assumption about the DGP encoded in a DAG. The package provides an easy-to-use parametric estimation procedure using a linear structural equations model if a causal effect is identifiable. More specifically, it provides an end-to-end estimation of structural causal models (SCM), which includes specification of the data generating process (DGP) using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), identification analysis, selection of adjustment variables (selection on observables), estimation of causal effects, and computation of numeric and graphical summaries of the estimation results.

Most of the functions of the ~idar~ package work as an envelop other functionalities that are distributed in various other R packages, including [[http://www.dagitty.net/][dagitty]] to with with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dosearch/index.html][dosearch]] for identification analysis, [[https://ggdag.malco.io/index.html][ggdag]] for visualization of DAGs, and [[https://lavaan.ugent.be/][lavaan]] for estimation of structural equation models (SEM).

* Instalation

# Install the development version (requires the package "devtools", so install it first if it is not installed already)

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code
devtools::install_github("DiogoFerrari/idar")
# If you don't want to update the dependencies, use: (you may need to install some dependencies manually)
devtools::install_github("DiogoFerrari/idar", dependencies=F)
#+END_SRC

NOTE: it may be necessary to create a token to install the package from the git repository in case it is private (see note at the bottom of help page in R by running =help(install_github)=).

* Usage

Here is a simple example (for more information, see =help(idar)=).

#+NAME: 
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code

## Use a DAG to encode the DGP
dag = '
U -> X
U -> Y
X -> Z -> Y
X -> Z -> X2 -> Y
X -> X3 -> Y
U [pos="1,1", unobserved]
X [pos="0,0"]
X2 [pos="1.5,-1"]
X3 [pos=".5,-1"]
Z [pos="1,0"]
Y [pos="2,0"]
'

## simulate data (for demonstration)
df=simulateDAGdata(dag, seed=1)

## identification analysis
identification('X', 'Y', dag)
identification('X', 'Y', dag, plot=T) # generate a plot
## estimation of the SCM
fit=estimate(cause='X', effect='Y', dag, df)
print(fit)

## plots
plot(fit)
plot_identification('X', 'Y', dag, T, T, fit=fit)

## fit measures
globalfit(fit)
localfit(fit)
